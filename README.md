# This app is hosted on Netlify

So far, all I'll let you see on first-sight is the custom 'coming soon' page. You can view that project here: [Bei Ya Jioni](https://www.beiyajioni.shop).

The app is going to be an online marketplace and networking solution for vendors and buyers alike.

## /login

This takes you to the login page.


### /new

Takes you to the 'create new product page'

If you're going to be running it locally, however, you need to download the project files and run:
### `npm install`
to get all the dependencies installed.

Thereafter, you will have to run npm start to view it on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

mail me here if you wanna collab to make this a reality:
